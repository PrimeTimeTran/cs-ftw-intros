## Discussion Questions

You'll be in groups. Each team has 3-4 questions to answer. They've very open-ended questions that will require you to flex your Google + StackOverflow muscles. Since this is our first discussion section, we'll allocate a little more time to getting used to this flow (in future sessions, we'll only spend about 30 minutes here, but today we'll spend the rest of the morning). 

The teachers will bounce from group to group to help moderate discussion, and after some time we'll ask someone from each group to present, using the "present" feature on Toucan. For simplicity, we'll ask each group to nominate just one person to screen share / present. But since we're going to do this every day, we literally have almost a hundred more of these sessions - everyone will get a chance to practice / present a lot. 

### Group A

We introduced markdown in class, but didn't really go over it in detail. (This document is written in markdown.)

* What is Markdown, and why is it called Markdown?
* What are some common use cases for Markdown?
* Walk us through some common Markdown syntax. (Headings, bold text, italic text, lists, code blocks, and tables). You might use a resource like https://www.markdowntutorial.com/. 
* What are the best ways to edit Markdown in Visual Studio Code? 

### Group B

Yesterday we introduced GitHub as a way to store files. However, there's a LOT of stuff built into GitHub that make it better than just some file server.

* Show some "trending" repositories via https://github.com/trending.
* You can "star" repositories, and it's often a measure of how popular a repository is. Share some information about the "most starred" repositories (available at https://gitmostwanted.com/top/stars/)
* What is/are "GitHub Actions"?

### Group C

We talked yesterday a bit about common web apps, and frontends vs backends. We'll learn JavaScript with React and NodeJS in this course, but there are a lot of other options out there. 

* What are other popular languages used in web programming?
* What are some other popular frameworks for web programming? (hint: use Google)
* What is the difference between a "framework" and a "language"?
* What is jQuery?

### Group D

We spent quite a bit of time with Visual Studio Code! You'll learn to live inside Visual Studio Code. We suggested some extensions yesterday.

* Go over each extension from our page yesterday, explain what it does and why it's useful.
* Try to find a few more extensions that could be useful. 
* Investigate Visual Studio Live Share, and give a quick demo to the class.
